# Kanten
Kanten is an Android App designed for training exercise with a Hangboard in order to increase finger strength for climbing.
You can put together up to three training modules to build a training session. In each module you can set hang time,
 rest time and the number of repetitions, which form a set. You can choose the number of sets and the length of the break
you want to do in between.
